			<h1>Hour of Code<br />Programming Challenges</h1>
			<p>
				In this project, you'll be modifying the source code of a basic browser game, to change the game's rules.
			</p>
			<p>
                Here are some challenges to solve. You will find hints to help you along.
            </p>

			<h2>Part 1 - Change some settings</h2>
			<ol class='steps'>
				<li>
					Open up the <code>codecreate</code> folder within Brackets (File &rarr; Open Folder). Once you have it open, you will see some files and folders. We'll be starting out with the <code>hour_of_code.js</code> file, inside the <code>js</code> folder.
				</li>
                <img class='screenshot' src='./screenshots/01.png' />

                <li>
                    <p>To launch the game, click the lightning button on the top right corner in Brackets. You should now be able to play the game.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Now let's get back to the <code>hour_of_code.js</code> file. Notice there are some settings you can change here. For example, towards the bottom, there is a line that says: <pre>ship_speed: 200,</pre> Try changing the number to a bigger number, such as 500, and <strong>save the file</strong>. Now if you go back to your game, you should see that your ship goes faster.
                </li>
				<li>
					If you want to add more enemies to the game, find the line that says: <pre>number_of_enemies: 6,</pre> and change it to something higher, like 12, which is the maximum.
				</li>
				<li>
					Now let's do something a bit more involved. Let's make the enemies shoot at random times. To do this, find the function called <code>enemy_fire_speed</code>. Inside the function, between the curly braces, you'll see a line that says: <pre>return 2000;</pre> Try changing it to <pre>Math.random() * 2000;</pre> and save the file. You should now notice the enemies firing more randomly.<br />
                    <code>Math.random()</code> is a function that represents a random number between zero and one, and the star <code>"*"</code> is the "times" sign.
				</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Part 2 - Change some images</h2>
			<ol class='steps'>
				<li>

            </ol>

		<div>
            <h2>Part 3 - Change some rules!</h2>
			<ol class='steps'>
				<li>
					Now let's make our ship invincible.

            </ol>
