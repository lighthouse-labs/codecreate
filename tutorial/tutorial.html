			<h1>Hour of Code<br />Programming Challenges</h1>
			<p>
				In this project, you'll be changing the rules of a basic game by modifying its source code.
			</p>
			<p>
                Here are some challenges to solve. You will find hints to help you along.
            </p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Part 1 - Change some settings</h2>
			<ol class='steps'>
                <li>
                    Open the program called Brackets (most likely on your desktop)
                </li>
				<li>
					Open up the <code>codecreate</code> folder within Brackets (File &rarr; Open Folder). Once you have it open, you will see some files and folders. We'll be starting out with the <code>hour_of_code.js</code> file, inside the <code>js</code> folder.
				</li>
                <img class='screenshot' src='./screenshots/01.png' />

                <li>
                    <p>To launch the game, click the lightning button on the top right corner in Brackets. You should now be able to play the game.</p>
                </li>
                <img class='screenshot' src='./screenshots/02.png' />

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Remember: lines that start with "//" (two slashes) are ignored in the program!</strong>
                        They are called "comments", and are left as notes for others to read.
                    </p>

                    Now let's get back to the <code>hour_of_code.js</code> file. Notice there are some settings you can change here. For example, towards the bottom, there is a line that says: <pre>ship_speed: 200,</pre> Try changing the number to a bigger number, such as 500, and <strong>save the file</strong>. Now if you go back to your game, you should see that your ship goes faster.
                </li>
				<li>
					If you want to add more enemies to the game, find the line that says: <pre>number_of_enemies: 6,</pre> and change it to something higher, like 12, which is the maximum.
				</li>
                <li>
                    Feel free to try changing some other values. For example, you can try making your spaceship bigger.
                </li>
				<li>
					Now let's do something a bit more involved. Let's make the enemies shoot at random times. To do this, find the function called <code>enemy_fire_speed</code>. Inside the function, between the curly braces, you'll see a line that says: <pre>return 2000;</pre> Try changing it to <pre>Math.random() * 2000;</pre> and save the file. You should now notice the enemies firing more randomly.<br />
                    <code>Math.random()</code> is a function that represents a random number between zero and one, and the star <code>"*"</code> is the "times" sign.
				</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Part 2 - Change some images</h2>
			<ol class='steps'>
				<li>
					Let's start changing how some things look in the game, such as our spaceship. To do this, we will need to load up the file called <code>game.js</code> in Brackets.
				</li>
                <li>
                    Look at line 75 in <code>game.js</code>.
                    <pre>
// this is your spaceship
game.load.image('spaceship', 'images/ship2.png');</pre>
                    <p>
                        Notice that a file is being loaded as the picture for the spaceship. We can change this to a different image file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try changing it to a horse:
                        <pre>game.load.image('spaceship', 'images/horse.png');</pre>
                        This works because there is a file called <code>horse.png</code> inside the <code>images</code> folder.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may open up the <code>images</code> folder and find other pictures that you might like to use!<br />
                    You can also do the same for the enemies.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class='pagebreak'>Part 3 - Change some rules!</h2>
			<ol class='steps'>
				<li>
					Now let's make our ship invincible.
                    <p>
                        In <code>game.js</code>, go to line 267.
                        <img class='screenshot' src='./screenshots/03.png' />
                        You can try getting rid of the lines that say: <pre>methods.explode(player);
methods.restart(true);</pre>by either deleting them, or adding "<code>//</code>" at the start of the two lines.
                        <p>
                            You should now notice that nothing happens when an enemy bullet hits your ship.<br />This is because the code you just removed was responsible of making an explosion, and restarting the game.
                        </p>
                    </p>
				</li>
                <li>Make the enemies explode when your ship hits them
                <p>Find line 235, where you should see the <code>playerAlienCollision</code> method.
                    <img class='screenshot' src='./screenshots/04.png' />
                    Here, there are two separate lines we'll need to remove. First is to prevent our player from dying:
                    <pre>// player.kill();</pre>
                    And the second is to prevent the game from restarting:
                    <pre>// methods.restart(true);</pre>
                    With these two lines disabled (or removed), now it should just be the enemy that explodes when you touch them!
                </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
